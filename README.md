# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent financial transactions using real-world, highly imbalanced banking data.

The project focuses on:
- Handling extreme class imbalance
- Business-oriented evaluation metrics
- Comparing linear and non-linear ML models

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (high-recall baseline)
- Random Forest (precision-focused model)

## Dataset
Public credit card transaction dataset with anonymized features and severe fraud imbalance.

## Evaluation Metrics
Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
